I suspect that was what caused the RTL… A the risk of being nitpicky… the GCS almost never sends flight mode change requests, certainly it’s not responsible for failsafes. In general the only time the GCSs request flight mode changes is when the user requests “Follow-me”, “Fly to Here” or specifically hits one of the set-mode buttons (i.e. on the MP’s ac",RC_FAILSAFE

I’m using ArduCopter V4.0.5 on this quad. Arducopter realises there’s no pulses (PWM or SBUS) from the receiver and enters failsafe, same as if the throttle channel goes below the set PWM level.

But you have to careful to configure your radio to hold last received value on channels other than 3. If RC signal is lost you don’t want the receiver to tell Channel 8 to go low or it will shut down the engine in flight if RC failsafe activates.

# Companion Health App

This folder is intentionally separate from the main log-diagnosis benchmark
pipeline.

- `data/`: companion-health datasets and model artifacts
- `scripts/`: ingestion and validation tooling for companion-health data

Policy:
- Companion-health data is not used as production benchmark labels for
  `src/` diagnosis unless explicitly promoted by review.
